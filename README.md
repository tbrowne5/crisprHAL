## Model Data and Raw Data

This directory contains the crisprHAL Tev, crisprHAL eSp, and crisprHAL WT model training and hold-out test sets, with model-specific input lengths.

### Files in the RawData subdirectory:
* Experimental sequence count files used for score generation
* sgRNA/Cas9 target sites with adjacent nucleotide sequences
* R scripts for re-generating all control condition read count curation datasets â€” Warning: the R scripts will generate 100 datasets each
